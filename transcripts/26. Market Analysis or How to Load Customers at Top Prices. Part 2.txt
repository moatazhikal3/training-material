Okay.

After looking at the trend lines, I logged back into the load board.

Actually, you will notice that this one looks a little bit different.

For previous demonstrations, I was using data trackers edge and now I'm using data power and this subscription

is slightly more expensive, but I'm just going to use it because it has more tools.

And I want to show you all the set of tools that data has to offer.

Some of these tools will be available for you, some not, depending on what subscription you buy and

how much money you'll be paying monthly for the load boards.

So first thing actually I want to go to search loads and.

Let's just do a quick search here.

I don't know.

Driving.

Doesn't matter.

Atlanta, Georgia, for example.

Great.

Quick search.

So.

First thing that's available to us.

Let's say, for example, we're looking at this load over here.

We don't know the rate.

The broker hasn't posted his rate.

We can click on the load and we get the broker to carry a spot.

So this is a spot rate or an average rate based on historical statistics for the past 30 days, I believe.

I'm not sure it could be 90 days actually.

But historically this lane has been paying $2.21 per mile.

And even here we can see that it should be paying a minimum of $2.09 and a maximum of $2.39 per mile.

So already inside of the load board, while you're looking for loads, you can use this broker to carry

a spot to get a general idea of how much this load should be paying, or at least how much this load

has been paying in the past.

Of course, this statistics is taken from historical value, so if in the past months they've been paying

$2.21, it doesn't mean that today they're going to be paying $2.21.

So the reality might be quite different, but this could be a foundation, a starting point for you

to understand how much this load could be paying.

Actually, it's very good to pair this with the trend lines.

If you go see here and see, the average rate has been $2.21, you can go back to trend lines, see

that percentage change over the week or over the month and understand, okay, so they've been paying

$2.21, but the market has actually decreased and it means I might be looking at a lower rate or on

the contrary, they've been paying $2.21, but the market has increased.

So actually I should be asking for more than $2.21 I should probably be asking somewhere in the higher

range of $2.39 per mile or more.

This is very good to use this broker to carry your spot while looking at the trend lines, to see some

trends and to understand how close to this value you should be aiming for.

Okay, this is available in any load search, any load that I look for.

I can always check out the broker to carry a spot for any line, but I'm just leaving the search loads

going back to my load board.

So I have this little briefcase here and this is called Tools.

And this is these are the tools available with paid subscriptions of it.

So I'll go through each one of these.

First one is line makers.

Let's click on it.

This is a very interesting tool, although you see they're actually offering me lane makers premium.

I'm not even 100% sure what's included in the premium, but you can go and check it out for yourself,

see how much it costs, see if it's worth it.

But this is a great tool, especially when you're just starting to work with a carrier.

And actually it allows you to see what brokers have the most amounts of loads for your carrier.

So here report type.

I have carrier activity.

It's only available to me because I'm we're actually also brokers, so we buy broker accounts.

But for normal carriers it will usually just show broker activity and then it includes full or partial.

Doesn't matter for me.

I'm just going to use both.

So let's say I got a new carrier.

He is a flatbed, for example, and he's based in, let's say, Richmond, Virginia.

So I got this carrier, his relatively new he wants some loads from Richmond, Virginia.

I can go and click search here.

And this will actually show me the brokers that have the most load postings out of Richmond, Virginia,

in the past months.

So as you can see, the biggest one is transfer 22,000 load postings for flatbed out of Richmond, Virginia,

in the past month.

So that already gives me a clear understanding.

Okay.

The first broker I have to set up is DML transport, and I'm probably going to book a lot of loads with

them, so I better make good relationship with them for that carrier and then they can see some other

brokers.

Total quality logistics.

As you can see already only 2700 compared to 22,000.

So DML is definitely the leader in Richmond, Virginia.

But some other brokers I should be setting up my career with is total quality logistics.

King of Freight LLC.

Glen Berry Trucking, Tennessee Steel Haulers, R&R.

ET cetera.

ET cetera.

ET cetera.

So it gives us, I don't know how many about a dozen brokers that have the most loads coming out of

this specific city of Richmond, Virginia.

Now, let's say this same carrier out of Richmond, Virginia, tells me, hey, you know what?

I only want to travel down to North Carolina or up to New Jersey, for example.

Okay.

Origin, Richmond, Virginia, destination, North Carolina.

Okay.

Search.

Now this will show me the brokers that had the most load from Richmond going specifically to North Carolina.

You see, not even interesting that the one that had the most load postings is not even here.

So actually, this lets us understand that DNA has a lot of loads coming out of Richmond, Virginia

for flatbed, but not going to North Carolina.

If we want to go to North Carolina, we have to set up with Tennessee steel haulers.

So I guess a lot of steel is coming out from Virginia down to North Carolina and then GM, RL Total

quality logistics.

ET cetera.

ET cetera.

So the brokers actually have changed depending on the destination.

And then if he says he wants to go to North Carolina or New Jersey, we'll go ahead do the same for

New Jersey.

You see, Tennessee still holds the one that was the top one.

Going to North Carolina is actually not here anymore now.

Total quality logistics is the biggest broker that ships loads from Richmond, Virginia, to New Jersey.

And then you have the other brokers as well.

So this is a fantastic tool to understand what brokers to set up with, what brokers to set up your

career with, especially if you have a new career.

Go to rainmakers, check out the brokers, do some setups and immediately start building relationships

with those brokers.

Your careers will really appreciate it, especially if there are new careers.

They're not set up with many brokers yet.

They haven't done much business in the past.

You as a dispatcher can help them out, help them make their first money and, you know, keep this

customer for a really long time.

They'll stay with you.

They'll stick with you.

They'll not want to go to any other dispatcher.

All right.

Rainmakers Fantastic tool.

Oops.

My will.

Dyson So the next one is market conditions.

Let's click on this.

And Market condition index is pretty much let me just click somewhere.

Market condition index is pretty much just an index for a load to track ratio.

So once again, tight capacity hot, it will be shown in red.

Those are the areas with the highest low to track ratio.

And then on the contrary, the blue ones are the areas with the least load to try with the smallest

load to track ratio so we can choose buy equipment, van flat or reefer.

And here it's given us by the key market area.

But we can actually just choose, let's say by state and we can even use the timeframe prior business

days current even has a seven day forecast or prior seven days prior 30 days.

Let's choose current and let's just apply this filter here.

Let's see if it loads.

There you go.

So we can see in red hot states with the highest load to truck ratio for driving in blue color, those

have the lowest load to truck ratio.

So this gives us a pretty good indication.

You know, if my truck is in Georgia and I want to go to a cold state like Nebraska, they're going

to be paying me a very high rate.

And on the contrary, if I'm going from a cold state to a hot state from Nebraska to Georgia, I can

expect a rate that's below general market average.

So you can play around with this.

You can you can see by area by market.

Area market area is actually very interesting.

Because either rather than looking at states as a whole, we can look specific market areas and see

because in a certain state there could be hot zones and there could be cold zones.

Look at Texas.

So Texas has cold zones.

East of Texas is always hot.

This is Dallas area.

This is Houston area, the always hot.

And then other areas like this big one is a desert.

So there's usually no loads here.

And this this is shown to us by the market index.

Okay, let's move away from the market condition index and look what else is available to us in these

tools.

So we looked at lane makers, we looked at market conditions.

Here's a quick rate search.

This is actually a very, very simple tool.

We just choose an equipment, let's say, for example, reefer, and then we choose a lane.

Miami, Florida to, I don't know, Atlanta, Georgia, for example.

And then we click search and we get our average rate.

So average rate for reefer on this lane is $1.84 and it ranges from $1.49 to $2.12 and that's $1,222

per trip.

And we can actually this is broker to carrier spot.

We can actually see shipper to carrier contract.

So we see that the contract rate is actually relatively higher.

It's $1,667 when a carrier gets the load directly from the shipper and it's only $1,222 when you get

the same load from the broker.

So very simple tool.

This is the same thing as what's available to you when you search for loads.

But if you don't want to go and do a full search, you can just very quickly check the lane.

That's why it's called a quick rate search.

Okay.

So then we have the trend lines.

We've already seen that that's available to us.

Data directory.

That's just a directory where you can search companies.

I'm not going to click on it now, but you can search by number or by company name by phone number,

and you can search any carrier or any broker.

Okay.

So all of the tools are not really important to us and my subscription allows me to search for trucks

so I can actually go and search for loads and then go and search for trucks and kind of compare that

statistics.

That's going to be the same statistics as the load to truck ratio that we've already seen.

Okay.

So data is not the only load board that collects data and provides analysis tools.

Actually, the next module, module six is going to be all about load boards and how to get subscribed

to them.

The two main competitors of data are truck stop and one, two, three load boards.

Truck Stop provides a very similar set of tools to data.

You can check average rates load to track ratio and rate trends.

I'm not going to stop and show it to you.

It's very, very similar to data.

You'll have no problem using it, although it's a bit tricky to get for a beginner dispatcher unless

your employer provides an account for you.

But what I do want to show you today is 1 to 3 load boards and the tools it provides because it's the

easiest load board to get for a beginner dispatcher, it's most likely you will have a one, two, three

load board account even before you have a data account.

So you'll most likely have access to it.

And let's see what tools are available here.

So I'm logged in to my account.

This is how my dashboard looks here on the left.

I have the menu, I have find loads.

It's essentially the exact same thing as load search on data.

You'll be able to use it.

No problem.

I have load availability here, so it's called a density list.

This is actually the exact same thing we saw on the data trackers edge, if you remember the in and

out ratio.

So this is the same here.

Inbound will be the in and outbound will be the out.

But one, two, three load board also provides us information on the state loads the loads inside the

states so I can scroll and it provides me all the states and then I can also sort it by trailer type

and by specific region as well.

It's not something it allows me to do.

And then we also have the density map.

This is very, very similar to the one we saw on the gig.

Again, this one shows the load to truck ratio, except the color coding is different.

So here green means high loads are available, medium is orange, means loads are slightly limited and

then red low loads are limited.

And then once again I can just go to each state and it will show me the in and out ratio very, very

similar to get.

So if you don't have a data account yet, you'll be able to get one, two, three load board account

very easily after you watch module six and you'll have all these tools available to you.

Another thing I want to show you is the load planner over here.

This is something unique to the one, two, three load board.

So actually here I can add a truck and I can choose my equipment.

Van, reefer, flatbed.

Let's just go with Van and I can enter miles per gallon so I can enter the fuel consumption of the truck.

And it will show me not just the total rates, but also the profits after the fuel.

So if if you talk to your driver, you can get the the mileage, the fuel consumption that his truck

gets and you'll be able to provide that statistics for them if they want.

So I'm just going to save this truck here quickly.

And this is actually going to build a route plan for me.

So this is a great tool for beginners and let's see how it works.

Where is your truck located?

So I can put in a date.

Okay.

Let's just say like today Origin Point and let's say Indianapolis, for example.

We'll go for Indiana this time.

Here we go.

Indianapolis, Indiana.

Okay.

And then where would you like to be in a few days?

I can input a date.

Let's well, if we start it on Wednesday, let's say we have Wednesday to Wednesday, a full week and

then destination.

I can choose.

Let's say we we're loading this truck for a week and then we need to bring it back to Indianapolis.

There you go.

Okay, so this is supposed to give us a route plan for a week worth of work for a truck coming out of

Indianapolis.

And that needs to come back to Indianapolis here.

States served.

I can choose specific states where this carrier operates.

If I have limits.

For now, I'm just going to leave it.

I'm going to leave it, you know, all the states.

So let's see how this works.

Oh, yeah, I can choose certain regions.

I'm not going to do that now.

Let's give it full freedom and let's see what kind of route plan it creates for us.

So load size here.

I can only choose full loads.

This will not help me with the partial load consolidation.

Maximum length, of course, 53ft, maximum weight.

Let's just go wherever £45,000 maximum posting age.

Okay.

So if I want to see only recent loads, then I can choose 30 minutes or 1 hour.

Or if I don't really care, I can choose eight hours.

So it will be choosing amongst loads that have been posted no later than eight hours ago and then maximum

loads per trip.

This also depends on on my carrier.

Maybe he wants to.

He's okay to do one load every day.

Or maybe he wants to only go out and come back.

So this way I will choose maximum loads per trip too.

So I can only do one load out, one load in.

I'm just going to keep it.

Whatever I'm in.

Five loads is doable in one week, so I'm just going to put five radius limits.

This is going to be my dad had maximum deadhead is going to be 100 miles.

Okay.

I'm okay with that.

And load mile range.

I can also play around with that.

I don't know if my carrier, for example, only wants to do one day load.

Well, let's choose it.

Let's say my carrier only wants to do one day loads.

And this way I know that he can do maximum 750 miles.

Or let's even say maybe he can do maximum.

Oops.

It's not very convenient to use.

Let's say he only does maximum 750.

Wow.

This doesn't let me choose.

He only does maximum 700, 650 miles.

There you go.

I hope it works.

Yeah.

Maximum 650 miles.

So in the load mile range, I'm putting a maximum of 650 miles.

Let's just do it here.

Maximum loss per trip.

Ten because anyway, the, the largest or the longest load it will show me is actually 650 miles.

And then I can either do the leg view and choose each load individually or I can do a trip view.

So this will actually build a whole trip for me.

Okay, let's check what we put one week.

Let's find trips.

So now this is analyzing hundreds of thousands of possible routes or actually more than a million possible

routes and supposedly right now is going to present me an optimal route plan for my truck, for my drive.

And that's starting on Wednesday and needs to come back to the same place, Indianapolis, Indiana on

Wednesday.

Wow.

This is taking very long to analyze.

Okay.

There you go.

So what did it provide?

This trip has seven loads.

Wow.

Mileage 2541 miles.

The total deadhead is 411 418 revenue per day, $1,192 Costs fuel costs per day, $455.

So that's taken from my mile per gallon fuel consumption and total cost of tolls per day is $11.

So the profit per day is $725.

It's actually not so bad.

Let's see, what are the loads?

There you go.

So it starts with the first one, Point A to point B, it took me from Indiana to Kentucky and then

from.

Indiana to Alabama.

Well, I guess I had to death.

I guess I went down to.

Kentucky, but then had to dead head back to Indiana, then in the end a little bit.

And then it took me to Alabama from Alabama to Kentucky, Ohio to Virginia, Virginia to Georgia, Georgia

to Georgia, Georgia, back to Indianapolis.

So this actually did pretty well.

I don't know in reality how this would work out.

Obviously, it hasn't booked these loads for me, but it provided me the company.

So the brokers that have these loads and now I can call these brokers you see here, call the company

directly to confirm availability and rate.

So based on this route plan, I can start calling brokers and then negotiating.

Maybe I will even be able to negotiate more than the load board provided me because for each load I

can confirm my rate so I can actually tell them like, Hey, you told me that I can book this load for

$1,000, but actually I got 1000 hundred dollars.

So then it will recalculate my daily profits.

There you go.

It's it will look for loads for you.

It will make a route plan for you.

I think this is a fantastic tool.

If I were you, I would play around with it a little bit, see how to use it to the full potential and

utilize it in my day to day operations.

So that's the load planner.

What else do we have here on the one, two, three load boards?

My loads post tracks, rate check rate check is going to be the same as the quick rate lookup we just

saw on that.

So I can just input the pickup location, delivery location.

It will give me average rates.

Profit calculator.

Once again, I can input the mileage how much I get per gallon, total cost.

Even dispatch fee is available here.

So you can really use this 1 to 3 load board to provide some additional value for your carrier.

You can when you start working with a new customer, you can tell them, hey, not only do dispatching,

but I'll also calculate your profitability so you can input your dispatch fee here.

Let's say you take 4% if you check with him, how many miles per gallon his truck makes?

You can not only book loads for him, but actually calculate his profits.

So that's extremely convenient.

And then we have a mileage calculator.

So that's also a very good tool.

If you're not satisfied with Google Maps or you can double check your your maps, you can go here and

actually input an exact address, Not necessarily.

You can just put a city.

Let's just try it in Atlanta, Georgia, for example, going to Miami, Florida.

Mhm.

Miami, Florida.

There you go.

Calculate.

So.

You can double check your mileage here and actually total total cost.

So there are many questions about how to calculate tolls.

There you go.

You can use one, two, three load board to calculate tolls.

And the reason you can double check this because it uses Google map for interactive maps, but it also

uses PC Mailer, which is a GPS, a map that's made specifically for truckers.

So the routes in this map will be specific for trucks.

And if there is, there are some roads that that 18 Wheeler truck cannot go to.

Google Maps will not show that to you.

But PC Miller will.

So this is actually a great tool to double check your your routes, your mileage and your total cost.

And then once again, they included the profit calculator in here as well.

So you can also do the profit calculations.

Here's what you get with one, two, three load board subscription.

The tools are fantastic, and in the next module, I'll show you how to get subscriptions to all these

load boards.
