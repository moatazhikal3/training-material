Hey, we're getting to the part every dispatcher enjoys the most.

You found a great load.

You filled out the documents.

You're just sitting there waiting, sipping coffee, completing other tasks, and suddenly an email

arrives with the subject line rate confirmation.

At this moment, each dispatcher releases serotonin, the hormone of happiness.

But your work doesn't end here.

Let's figure out what we're supposed to do with this email.

A rate confirmation, also known as a load confirmation, is a legally binding document that confirms

the agreed upon rate and load details between the broker and the carrier.

This document contains a full load description, loading and unloading times, special instructions,

and most importantly, the agreed upon rate.

It's our job to check this document and sign it.

Let's take a look at the sample rate confirmation.

Okay, so I found this old rate confirmation that we can use as an example.

Let's just see what it contains.

So this one is called carrier rate and load confirmation.

And it came to us from a broker called Steam Logistics or Steam Logistics International.

We have their full address here and we have the contact of the person who sent it to us, Shawne Merriman,

And we have his email.

Shawne Merriman at Steam logistics.com.

So we have the load number here 132061 the date this was it's an old rate confirmation.

This was back in 2021 in September, by the way, you probably already noticed in the US they write

the months first and then the date.

So zero nine is September and then 14 is the date of 2021.

Equipment type driven bill of lading number.

They have a space for a bill of lading number, but they haven't included it and then motor carrier.

So here it's not listed, but typically it would list the name of the motor carrier.

So once again, if it was our sample, Dmitri Logistics, it would say motor carrier.

Dmitri Logistics, and then it would have my contact phone number or my email.

Total weight.

We know the exact weight of the load Â£26,438 and we're moving to shipper pickup.

So this is stop one where we picking up the load.

The facility has a strange name.

K1486K1486 NSD DC.

So this probably just a name of some kind of a warehouse.

That's why it has such a strange name.

And it's located in a city called Rialto.

K is abbreviation for California, so it's in Rialto, California.

And here we have the full address of this facility 1686 West Baseline Road, Rialto, California, USA.

And the zip code, 92376 expected date.

This is the date we have to show up for.

The pickup is zero 915.

So this is 15th of September 2021.

Shipping receiving hours are not listed, but appointed appointment required.

Yes.

So there is a strict appointment and we have the appointment time 1415 so 2:15 p.m. contact is not listed

pickup instructions.

There are no specific instructions, but there are shipper reference numbers.

We have three numbers here and pickup delivery numbers.

We have also three numbers here.

So all of this good stuff, all these numbers is what we're going to be sending to the driver.

And when the driver arrives, he's going to show the manager the facility at this warehouse or whatever

it is.

He's going to show them these numbers and they will know exactly what product needs to be loaded in

this truck and they will know what truck has arrived and what is prepared for it.

And the same thing for the consignee.

Sometimes delivery is called a consignee receiver stop too.

So this one is called Unified Western Rock Commerce Distribution.

And once again, we have an address.

It's also in California, different city commerce.

California expected date zero 916.

So this is the next date.

And once again, we have a fixed appointment at 1630 or 4:30 p.m. Delivery instructions arrive 30 minutes

early, keep doors sealed.

Conf Well, this is an abbreviation, so confirmation number is this long number.

And then once again continue references and pickup delivery numbers.

Once again, all of this is just needed for the driver.

This is something you must send to the driver when you're sending him the instructions.

If you're working with an owner operator, you can just send him this information directly.

If you're working with a driver, you will need to get this instructions separately.

Actually they put them very conveniently so that you can actually take a screenshot if the driver is

okay with that and just send them the screenshot.

That will save you some time.

Next shipment information.

As you can see, we don't have the number of units.

We don't have any information on the packaging, we only have the weight and commodity description.

So all we know actually is that we're moving snack foods, which I mean tells us nothing could be anything

and we know the exact weight.

So we don't have all of these descriptions, but this is something the driver will receive when he comes

to the pickup, when they give him the papers, the bill of lading, the bill of lading must have all

of this information.

And obviously you can ask the driver to send it to you so you have full information.

How is the product packaged?

If it's snack foods, it's probably packed.

I don't know if it's potato chips or something.

It's packed in its normal packaging and then it's put into boxes and then boxes are put into pallets.

So in the bill of lading, you should have information about the number of boxes, the number of pallets

and carrier fees, net freight charges, $750 total cost $750.

I'm not sure why they put it two times, but we know that this load is paying $750.

If you're interested about the rate per mile, actually, how we check the exact mileage on the on the

load when we're negotiating with the broker initially, we don't have the exact address.

The broker will not provide us the exact address until we book the load and receive the rate confirmation.

But now that we have the exact address, I can just copy it.

Go to my Google Maps.

Inputs the pickup location.

Uh, going this and then copy the address for the delivery location.

Now let's see what this load was paying.

So actually, it's only 50 miles.

This is a very short run, just 50 miles, and they're paying $750.

So the rate per mile is very high.

This is what typically happens on short loads because this load takes a full day.

You pick up on the 15th and deliver on the 16th.

They can't really pay, you know, $100 or $200.

Nobody's going to book it.

So they pay the low, low mileage loads, always have a higher rate per mile.

And finally, we have some additional nodes here on the bottom.

All shipments are subject to Steam Steam's broker carrier agreement.

So obviously before we started working with this broker, we signed the carrier agreement, no double

brokering, which means we cannot resell this load, so we cannot re broker this load.

We book this as a carrier and we must ship this load.

Please send final invoices and documents to AP at Steam logistics.com so we already know where to send

the invoice to.

Invoices will not be processed without pod.

Pod is a proof of delivery.

Is the signed bill of lading that the driver receives when he delivered the load.

And if you are a Triumph Bay customer and would like quick pay, then please send invoices and pod to

quick pay at steam logistics.com for priority processing.

So this is just information for when the load is already delivered.

Where to send an invoice.

If you want quick pay, you send an invoice to a different place.

So this is actually important information for a dispatcher or for whichever person in the company will

be doing invoicing.

That's it.

This invoice.

Sorry, this information actually doesn't have a spot for signing, but all rate confirmation needs

to be signed.

So even even though it doesn't have a spot for signing, what you would do is you would sign the rate

confirmation in whatever space is blank, whatever space is available, and then you would send it back

to the broker after sending the side rate confirmation back to the broker.

The load is officially booked.

Now we need to coordinate our driver and make sure he starts moving to the pickup.

If the carrier you're working with is an owner operator, he's the company owner and the driver.

In that case, you can just send him the rate confirmation directly.

But if you're working with a company that has a hired company driver that gets paid by the mileage,

typically the owner doesn't want him to see the whole rate.

Con in particular, owners don't want their drivers to see the rate of the load is paying and the broker

from whom the load was booked.

In this case, you will write out the driver's instructions and send them to the driver separately via

email or text message.

Making drivers instructions is super simple.

Just include all the information from the rate confirmation except the rate itself and the name of the

brokerage.

Make sure it contains all the info the driver needs time and place of loading and unloading, cargo

type and weight, all the reference numbers, temperature and other additional instructions.

There isn't one single template on how to send the driver instructions.

Just ask your driver what's the most convenient form for him to receive it?
