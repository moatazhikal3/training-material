Hello, entrepreneur.

This module is especially for you.

You won't find this kind of information in any other training.

How to attract customers, How to sell your professional services.

These are probably the most discussed topics on all the forums and communities of dispatchers.

Despite the fact that the market is growing at an unprecedented rate and hundreds of new emcees are

registered daily, many dispatchers who decide to go the entrepreneurial way still face difficulties

in this area, and there is nothing strange about that.

Once I attended sales training by an awesome American business coach, Tony Robbins.

During his presentation, he said to someone, If you have 100oz of cocaine on your hands, you wouldn't

even be able to give it away for free.

So this is a reference to the fact that someone who understands nothing about marketing and sales would

not be able to sell his or her product even for free.

Frankly, I pretty to look at all the guys who have gone through all sorts of dispatcher training but

then have no idea how to begin to apply their knowledge and make money from it.

That's why I've set myself the task of doing everything possible to ensure that my students are not

among them.

Okay.

In this module, we're going to start with the simplest thing something you can sit down and do right

now and potentially find your first customer within days without any financial investment.

And with each new topic will reveal more and more tools and strategies for attracting carriers and selling

your services to them.

These techniques have been tested in practice by me personally, and I know for a fact that they work

because even a couple of years ago my company didn't have a marketing department or a sales department.

At that time, we were not yet hiring outside consultants and marketers.

I was personally responsible for all the marketing.

I found potential customers and signed them up to keep the whole team busy with work.

I've signed up several hundred carriers with my own efforts using the techniques I will describe right

here.

Now, of course, currently I no longer do this, but due to the involvement of professionals in the

team, I'm constantly continuing to learn new approaches.

All that's required from you is to dive deep into this task and make enough effort to achieve the goals

you've set for yourself.

So let's not waste any time.

Let's get right into it.

Cold Calling.

What's the most logical first step for attracting B2B customers?

It's of course, cold calling in various videos and courses on marketing.

I often hear people say that cold calling is dead, that it's not an effective strategy, that they're

much more effective options.

And yes, they're partly right.

However, this expert often talk about B2C business to customer marketing, selling services and products

to individuals.

In that case, I agree with them.

If you're selling, say, carpets, calling strangers and offering them carpets is probably not the

best idea.

But if you're trying to reach the director of a small transportation company, a cold call has one of

the highest conversions to a customer compared to other advertising methods.

Secondly, when these marketing experts talk about more effective options, they usually mean paid options.

Create your own website, set up context advertising and Google ads.

Then set up Google Pixel and create a retargeting campaign aimed at retargeting leads on social media.

That's pretty much what I hear after the words cold calls don't work well.

Well, it's all undoubtedly very effective.

And when you grow to a level where you have, say, more than ten dispatchers in your team, it's definitely

the right way to go.

Higher quality marketers pay money.

They'll build you a working marketing funnel and you'll be happy.

But we're talking now about attracting a customer for a new comer in this business for whom it doesn't

make sense to invest thousands of dollars in advertising.

A newbie just needs a customer here and now.

I spent two years personally attracting customers using this method, and to this day the salespeople

in my company on average sign up 2 to 3 new customers every single week just with cold calls.

Even though this these managers are also busy with other tasks most of the time.

So they're not just doing cold calling.

So what do we need to start calling carriers?

First of all, we need their contact information, their names and phone numbers.

I'll tell you where to get them.

Remember how I've been saying that hundreds of new trucking companies are registered every day in the

US?

Well, I know where to get their contacts for free.

This is invaluable information because, come to think of it, who is a better customer for a dispatcher

than a new player in the market?

Established trucking companies with lots of trucks have long had their own dispatch departments, so

it's more difficult to sign them up.

To attract them, you'll need a different approach.

We'll still learn how to deal with them in this module.

But for cold calling a new trucking company is a great audience.

So here is what you need to do.

Go to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration's Registry of Licenses and Insurance website.

You can find the link to this website in the lesson description.

Once you're on the website, click the continue button at the bottom.

On the next screen in the upper right corner, expand the menu that says Choose Menu Options and select

the Fmcsa register.

After selecting the desired option on the right side, click the Go button.

You will get a list of registered for the past ten working days.

Just download one of the PDF files and open it on your computer.

Each file is about 100 to 300 pages.

Not all the info here will be valuable for you.

Among other things, these files contain records of changes in the names of transportation companies,

records of applications for licenses that were rejected, company closures and so on.

What we're interested in is successful applications.

We have to scroll down until we get to the page titled Fitness.

I have a small document and I have it on page 60.

In some documents you have to flip through more than 100 pages.

You will find this page easily because the list of these companies will always look exactly like the

one in the picture I'm showing you.

Now, an important point.

This list will include different types of companies freight forwarders, freight brokers, carriers

of household goods, etcetera.

Remember the very beginning of the course in module two, if I'm not mistaken, we learned types of

transportation companies.

So the companies were interested in are interstate common carrier except household goods.

Most of the carriers in the list will be exactly that, but you will come across others too.

There is no need to call them.

They're not your target market.

That's it.

You can download ten lists at once with hundreds of new companies in each.

You will have their number, company name, legal address, phone number, and in many cases even the

full name of the owner.

I'll give you one more piece of advice.

The registry in the public domain only has lists for the past ten days, so every business day, one

new list is added and the oldest one is deleted.

So if you want to accumulate this database, you need to visit this website every ten days and download

these files.

You have to start doing this now because if you go to the latest list, which is, let's say, only

posted today, most likely all of the companies listed there have not yet begun to operate.

They have just been licensed.

So they're probably still doing paperwork or hiring drivers repairing trucks.

They could be up and running in a couple of weeks or maybe even in a couple of months.

You can call them anyway because you can negotiate and get them signed up in advance.

But it's still easier to sign a carrier who needs cargo right now.

For those who can't wait to start calling, I'll leave.

In the appendix of the lesson, a number of these files from 2021 so you can practice on them while

you build your own base.

So now you have the tool to collect contact information of newly registered carriers.

Absolutely.

For free.

There are alternative ways to get your hands on the databases of carriers.

You can search online and buy such databases from other people.

You can also go on LinkedIn and find contacts of managers of trucking companies.

But I'll give you another free tool to essentially collect contact information of every single registered

carrier in the United States so you can find any trucking company by its name, mic or dot number on

the Fmcsa Company Snapshot page.

Again, I attached the link to this website in the lesson description.

What you can do is just go on this site and type in numbers in a row.

So just pick a random 6 or 7 digit number such as, for example, 071340 check if this is active and

then collect contact information and then just continue going in order.

071341071342071343.

Etcetera.

Open the information about each mic.

Found those mics that are active and just start calling them.

This way you can manually find contact information of hundreds of thousands of trucking companies.

It would probably take several lifetimes to go through all of them.

So with these tools, your database of carriers is pretty much unlimited and you don't even have to

pay a dime for it.

All right.

Now that we've figured out how to find contacts of trucking companies to cold call, we need a way to

make calls to the United States.

If you live in the US, you already have your local number.

But if you live outside of the country, here are some recommendations.

So for calls, you will be using VoIP or voice over internet protocol.

In essence, you will call using your internet connection and the person on the other end of the phone

sees it as a regular phone call.

In my company we use Vonage as a VoIP provider.

It costs about $40 a month for each user.

The package includes unlimited incoming and outgoing calls to the US and Canada, as well as SMS and

media sharing.

Vonage also provides an admin portal where I can monitor each user, see call statistics and listen

to each conversation.

Each user can connect to telephony and make calls from either a computer or mobile app to manage an

entire dispatch department.

All these additions are vital.

But for a new dispatcher like yourself, you may consider other cheaper options.

Here are a couple of examples.

First one, if you're just starting out and not planning to make a huge number of calls right away and

don't want to pay for an unlimited package, consider the Dharmacon VoIP provider so their per minute

tariff for calls to the US starts at $0.007.

So that's less than $0.01 per minute.

They don't have any connection fees and the cost to connect a US phone number is about $2 per month

and incoming calls are also free.

Next one, Skype.com offers a great options for businesses at a low price.

Unlimited incoming and outgoing calls to the US for about $8 a month.

But on top of that, you have to pay for us phone number I think another $7 per month.

The total is about $15 for fully unlimited calling and messaging to the US.

Another VoIP provider I've used in the past is dialpad.com.

It's a cheaper alternative to Vonage with its own set of great add ons.

For about $20 a month you get a phone number, unlimited calls, texts and media sharing.

Plus you can set up a voicemail greeting.

So this greatly enhances your reputation when someone calls you before you connect.

They get to an answering machine, which you can customize.

For example, it might say, Hello and welcome to ABC Dispatch Company.

If you'd like to connect with the dispatch department, please press one.

To reach the accounting department, please press two and so on.

Of course, by pressing any button, the person will get to you.

But for those who call for the first time, it creates the image of a more serious, established company.

Right now, Dialpad provides a 14 day trial package that's 14 days of unlimited calls, absolutely free.

And I think that's just awesome.

So there are thousands of VoIP providers.

If you don't like any of my options, just go to Google and pick one you like.

Just don't forget to check if they provide an American phone number.
