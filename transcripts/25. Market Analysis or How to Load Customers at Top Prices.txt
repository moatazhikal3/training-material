Hello.

We're starting to analyze the market and the first thing we will touch upon are the tools of macro analysis.

We already know that in order to be certain that we'll be able to get a truck out of an area within

a state, we should pick areas as close as possible to major cities, ports and transportation hubs.

However, when we have a truck to load, we need to decide on an overall direction.

That is to choose the state to which we will send those trucks.

Before we go on one of the load boards and start looking for available freight, we can check the Bureau

of Transportation and Statistics and look at freight flows by state.

Follow the link attached to this lesson to the.gov website to the freight flow by state page.

Here we can select the state we're interested in and look at the statistics of inbound and outbound

shipments.

This way we will know how much each state trades with the other states, which will give us an idea

of which states will be the easiest to get the truck out at a good price.

All right.

So I've logged in to the freight flows by state page of the Bureau of Transportation Statistics website,

and we have a map here and we have a couple parameters to put in.

It's actually quite straightforward, really.

When you log in, all the parameters are already put in for you.

So we have the state, um, by default, it's choosing the state of Alabama, but we'll be choosing

different states.

Let's just start with Alabama for now for the year.

The latest year available is 2021.

So that's the one we're choosing for the measure.

We're keeping the current value in millions of dollars.

You can later play around with other values if you want.

And for the type we just keep all.

But then once again, if you want to play around with it, you can check for domestic, you can check

for export and import.

But for our purposes, we're just going to keep type of freight all.

And so here we go.

We move on to the map.

We have chosen Alabama.

Alabama is right.

Oops.

There you go.

Okay, so we've chosen Alabama is right here and by the color.

So the darker the color, the more, um, the state of Alabama trades with the state.

So we see the darkest one is Georgia.

It has the current current value.

So Georgia is trading the most with Alabama and we also see Florida, Mississippi, Tennessee.

So, I mean, it makes sense that the bordering states are the ones that Alabama trades with the most.

But if we move a little bit further, we can see that also Alabama trades a lot with Texas and with

California.

So that gives us an idea.

If we have a truck in Alabama, it's most likely that you will be able to find a higher number of loads

going out to those states and then we can choose a different state.

I don't know.

Let's go for Colorado, for example.

As you can see, the map changed.

So now we're here in Colorado, and Colorado does trade a lot with its bordering states.

It trades a lot with Wyoming as well as Utah, Nebraska and Kansas.

But it actually trades the most with California, Texas, and it trades a lot with Illinois.

So that's about it.

Another great free tool for understanding the market is trend lines.

The link is attached to this lesson.

Data is a major player in the market.

The company earns money not only from the load board but also from other logistics related products.

One of them is collecting and selling data from market analysis.

You can buy a whole range of analysis tools from data that vary in price, but a novice dispatcher doesn't

need to spend too much money on these products.

What will present in this lesson will be sufficient.

Okay, here we are on the Data Trend Lines website.

We're on the main page and the first thing we see here is a weekly snapshot by the numbers.

So these are percentage changes in demand and supply for transportation over periods of time.

And we have the weekly period of time, monthly period of time and a yearly period of time.

So let's look at let's look at the monthly period.

So this is statistics between April 2023 and May 2023.

First thing we see is spot load posts plus 29.4%.

So this means that there are pretty much 30% more loads available on the market in May 2023 than in

April 2023.

And then we see spot truck posts which grew by 8.6%.

So actually the number of trucks available also increased, but the number of loads increased by 30%,

the number of trucks increased by 9%, which indicates that actually the demand for transportation grew

faster than the supply, rather more loads on the market.

But there are not as many more trucks available on the market.

So these statistics usually means that the rates, the prices for transportation have increased between

the between the months of April and the months of May, just because of the increase of the demand.

And then we see for each type of equipment for driver and flatbed and reefer load to truck ratio.

So load to truck ratio is essentially the ratio of demand.

And the demand for transportation went up by pretty much 30, almost 32% for driving.

And then the spot rates.

So average price is actually haven't increased, even though the demand became higher.

This is normal.

Usually it takes a bit of time for the prices to adjust to the changes in demand and supply.

So it would be expected that the prices would grow over time if this number of demand remains higher

than the supply and we have the same for the flatbed.

So actually for the flatbed, the load to truck ratio didn't increase.

It went down a little bit.

And we see that the rates also went down, but not so much.

So flatbed pretty much stayed at the same level.

And then for the reefer, we once again see saw a higher increase, 34% in the low to truck ratio,

but a very small increase in rates.

And in the end, we have the fuel prices.

So the fuel prices have been going down little by little, which also has an effect on the rates.

When fuel prices go up, the rates go up slightly.

And when they go down, the rates also go down.

So.

You can check out the statistics and follow it weekly.

If you log in to TRENDLines every week, you'll be able to check the weekly statistics, which will

give you an understanding of how much you can negotiate with brokers.

So let's say you're always running the same lane and you usually, you know, your driver usually runs

it for $1,000, but then you see a very big spike in the number of load posts and a very big spike in

load to track ratio.

And this could mean for you that for the next week you can try and negotiate a higher rate with the

brokers for the same lane.

So maybe instead of a thousand, you ask them for 1200 or 1300 and most likely they will have to provide

it to you just because there's not so many other trucks that can take this load for the same price.

So if you follow the statistics, you'll have a better understanding of the market.

If we scroll down, we see to the next point, which is national spot rates.

So these are actually nationwide countrywide averages for each of the three key types of equipment.

So in June 2023, the average rate for a driven is $2.09.

So this is a rate per mile.

So for each mile traveled, truckers have gotten $2.09 on average.

For flatbeds, it's $2.66 per mile.

And for reefers it's $2.48 per mile.

Once again, this statistics updates monthly, so you should be going on trend lines and you should

be checking the statistics just to understand where the market is at right now.

Let's see what else is available here.

Fuel prices.

You can check out the percentage change and this is average fuel price per gallon in the US right now,

which is $3.80.

If we go back up to our trends snapshot by the numbers here where it says view trends, you can also

see a demand and capacity map for each type of equipment for drive and flatbed and reefer.

And you can see a national rates map once again for each type of equipment.

So let's choose a let's choose flatbeds.

Let's take a look at flatbed demand and capacity map.

So this is again, low to track ratio.

Low to track ratio is a very important indicator.

It explains how much demand there is for transportation and it explains how the pricing for transportation

is formed.

So on this map, we have all our states and the darker the color gets, the higher load to truck ratio,

there is meaning higher demand for transportation with this specific type of equipment, flatbed.

So we can see the darkest colors on this map are here on the southeast Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama,

Arkansas, Oklahoma.

All of these states will pay a rate above market average coming out of this state.

Also, South Carolina and a few other states in the north, Idaho, Oregon, there's not enough flatbed

trucks in this area.

So if you have a truck in Oregon or Idaho, you can expect a higher than average rate and also Maine.

I guess there's just not there's usually not too many loads coming out of Maine.

It's a small place, not much production, but I guess there's just not enough flatbed trucks to keep

up with the demand.

So you can look at this map.

It also gets updated on a monthly basis and you can look at this map for each type of equipment and

then for flatbeds.

Another thing we can look at is national flatbed rates.

So this is going to be another map, but it's just going to show average rate per mile for each of the

five zones of the US.

So for flatbeds at the moment, Midwest area and southeast area, oops, like this southeast area are

paying the most meaning that coming out of these areas you will you can expect a rate around $2.79 and

then the western part of the US has the lowest demand for trucking in general and the lowest demand

for flatbeds right now.

So coming out of the west, you will get a lower rate of around $2.35 per mile.

So you can get a general idea coming from southeast to the west, you can expect a higher rate.

But coming back from the west to the southeast, you can expect a lower rate.
