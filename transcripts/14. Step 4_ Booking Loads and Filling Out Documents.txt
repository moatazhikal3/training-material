Welcome to your next lesson.

We're continuing to load our trucks.

In the last lesson, we did some work on the load board and spoke with the broker.

Here comes a very responsible and long awaited moment.

What to do when we found a load that works for us and we're ready to book.

Step one Verbally book the load.

Once you have agreed on the price and other details with the broker, you need to verbally confirm that

you're ready to take the shipment.

At this moment, you can simply say, All right, let's book it or okay, let's go for it or just okay,

send it over.

If the broker didn't ask for your number at the beginning of the conversation, they will definitely

ask for it.

At this point, I'm saying your number because as a dispatcher, you are representative of your carrier

and you work on behalf of their company before sending the load over to you.

The broker should check the number in the carrier database.

These databases usually have information on how many months or years the company has been operating

on the market, whether the company has violations, bad reviews, whether the license is active and

so on.

The final decision depends on the broker.

For example, some brokers work only with companies that operate for more than six months.

Some brokers work only with companies with more than five trucks and so on.

If the broker for some reason is not willing to give the load to your carrier, there's not much you

can do.

And most likely you'll have to look for another one.

When we get to the lesson on negotiating, we'll take a closer look at the points at which you you can

get what you want through proper communication and persuasion techniques.

But if all is well and the broker gave you the green light, it's time to work on the documentation.

After verbal agreement to book a shipment from both sides, there are two possible options to proceed.

Option one Your carrier has already worked with this broker in the past.

He has all the required documentation.

The agreement between the companies is already signed, and all he has to do is send you the confirmation.

It's an official document confirming that this carrier is assigned to transport this load.

We'll come back to this document and look at it in detail.

First, let's look at second option.

Option two Your carrier has never worked with this broker and you need to do a setup.

Doing a setup or getting set up means that you need to exchange a number of documents in order to start

cooperation.

Now we're going to look at these documents.

Suppose you're booking a shipment with a new broker.

He checks your mic and says, We need to get set up.

Let me send you a setup packet.

What's your email?

In this situation, the setup packet means the document packet the broker will send you via email to

fill out.

What do you do?

Give him your email and wait for the documents before hanging up.

Be sure to get the broker's name and a contact phone number.

Often when you call a brokerage company, you will come across an auto attendant.

A voice menu which will then most likely transfer you to the first available representative.

To avoid wasting time looking for the right person, it's better to immediately get their direct phone

line or their extension.

This is their internal company phone code, which you can enter after calling the main line and switch

to it.

So we verbally agreed on a load with the broker, provided them our email address and received a setup

packet.

Well, actually I just found a random old packet in my past emails.

Generally setup packets come in completely different forms and each one is designed differently.

The two main options are an on line packet or a single PDF document like the one in front of me.

For online packets, brokers usually buy a subscription to a software program that allows them to send

process and store all the setups in one convenient program.

Those who don't want to pay for the software simply attach the PDF file to the email.

I don't recommend printing it out and filling it out by hand.

It just seems like extra work to me.

It's much more convenient to use a PDF editor a program that allows you to edit and sign PDF documents.

I use this one.

You can see the name here at the top.

It's free.

I started using it years ago and I just kind of got used to it.

You might want to use some official paid ones.

You can use Adobe.

It's up to you.

Let's go over this set of documents.

So the company we received this from is called SJA Transport.

First page is a certificate of membership in Transportation Intermediary Association, and it shows

that there are distinguished member in good standing.

So it's not really necessary, but they just want you to know that they are legitimate broker and they're

a part of such an association.

You don't have to do anything with this.

Next page.

Once again, certificate of membership has qualified or exceeded the strict qualifications to be considered

a best broker affiliate.

This is the National Association of Small Trucking Companies.

So once again, this is just for the image.

They want to show you that they're qualified.

They're a good broker, and you should work with them.

Once again, we do nothing.

Next page, general information.

This is not necessary once again.

But it's good.

They put their legal name as an H.

Transport Inc..

Their full address.

All the phone numbers.

Their number Usdot number federal ID.

So federal ID is another name for employer identification.

Number.

Your ID encountered this document.

This is the Ein.

So they're putting the Ein number and established in 1994.

So once again, they're just trying to show that they've been around for a very long time and they're

serious broker.

They even provided credit references.

So this are probably some large transportation companies that they partner with.

And you can call the phone number and get a credit reference about this company.

Okay.

Moving on to the next one.

What do we have here?

Addendum to broker carrier agreement.

So we haven't seen the agreement itself yet, but here is an addendum.

This is SJA Transport Quickpay program.

So we haven't actually got to the information on the payments yet, but if you remember from a previous

module, we said that brokers typically pay carriers within 30 days.

Those carriers who don't want to wait can opt for a factoring company which will pay them up front.

But some some brokers will also offer a quickpay.

So basically, if your carrier doesn't use factoring but still wants to get paid faster, the broker

will give them this option for a small fee.

So by quickly let's see, by quickly scanning this document, I see that they're offering payment within

three business days, excluding weekends for 3% of the gross amount of the approved freight bill.

So they'll charge 3% and instead of 30 days, they'll pay for in three days.

You can check with your carrier if they want this.

We can get this page signed and go for the quick pay option.

Actually, the good part is that with the quick pay program, we can choose which load we want to get

paid for faster.

So say a carrier is running out of funds and for some reason and maybe need some extra cash fast, they

will ask you to request.

On the next load.

And if the broker has such an option like this broker, you can do it just for that single load.

So that's convenient.

You can check with the carrier and then fill out this page request Quickpay.

Okay, moving on.

They provided their certificate of insurance for review.

Usually I would just check the policy.

Let's see where it is.

I would just check the dates on the policy, check that it's active.

Obviously this is an old rate confirmation.

They probably got it in 2018 or 2019.

But if this were a rate or sorry, not a rate confirmation, if this were a carrier packet that you

got today, you would just go and make sure that the policy is still active on today's date.

Okay.

Next page.

Whoa.

What is this?

Okay.

They decided to include an extract from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration database from

Fmcsa.

I mean, once again, this is not typical, but they can include anything they want in the carrier packet.

We can see this company is very serious about their reputation and they want you to know it.

It's likely they just want to prove that all the information they've written about themselves is true.

And here's the proof.

An excerpt from the government database.

Okay.

Very good.

Um, this is the broker license.

Once again, if this was today, you would just check that this broker license is active.

This is actually an old broker license.

I think now they look a bit different.

And let's see.

And this is finally the agreement.

So this is pretty much the only thing we're going to have to interact with.

Let's quickly scan through the agreement.

I'm only going to stop and explain a couple of key parts.

We're not going to spend time reading the whole agreement.

I'll leave this whole packet here so you can download it after the lesson if you want to dig deeper

into it.

First thing we're going to do, we're going to fill out the header.

So the agreement is entered into this blank day of months and years.

So I have to fill out the day.

We would just fill out.

To this day.

I will just put like zero one, make it nice.

Uh, let's just put zero 1st January.

2020.

I don't know.

Just as an example.

There you go.

It doesn't matter if it's not so straight.

Nobody cares.

Buying between AA Transport Inc, a registered property broker and included DMC number and blank, a

registered motor carrier.

So here we have to input the company name.

For the example.

I'll just put like matrix logistics and permit certificate numbers.

So here they're asking for the dot number.

Very often they'll ask for MCE number.

Let's say I'm putting in some very often they'll ask for an MMC number, but here they ask for Dot.

That's fine.

Fair enough.

Both are identifiers for a company.

Let's quickly go through what we have here.

So number one carrier represents and warrants that.

What do we have here?

A that carries registered motor carrier of property authorized to provide transportation under contracts.

So basically that we have the license to do this shell transfer the property under its own operating

authority and subject to the terms of this agreement.

So we cannot transport the goods under somebody else's authority.

Let's see, will not re broker, co broker, subcontract and sign Interline.

ET cetera.

ET cetera.

So basically, we're not allowed to resell this load based on this agreement.

If we book a load with them, then we have to run it once again under our own authority.

Let's see, shall remain in compliance during the term of this agreement.

So basically all of this, number one, is about Carrier being in compliance, having the license,

having a proper safety score, basically being allowed to move this load or any other load that will

move with them in the future.

I'm scanning through to number two, broker responsibilities.

So what is broker responsible Broker shall offer carrier at least three loads shipments annually.

I mean, I guess this is just a formality.

It doesn't make any sense.

What happens if they don't offer us a minimum of three loads?

It's no one's going to sue them.

So that's just makes no sense.

Carrier points Broker to conduct all billing services to shipper.

So we as a carrier cannot demand money from the shipper.

According to this contract broker is the one getting money from the shipper and any rates payment.

Let's see.

The parties agreed that broker is the sole party responsible for payment of carriers charges.

Once again, we can only demand money from the broker for for moving any load so we cannot get funds

from anybody else.

Broker shall maintain a surety bond and broker will notify Carrier immediately if it's federal operating

authorities revoked.

So this is once again, same as for the carrier broker based on this contract, must have all the legal,

all the authority, the licenses, everything in place in order to broker freight.

To us, broker responsibility is limited to arranging for, but not actually performing transportation

of a shippers freight.

Of course, broker will not be transporting the freight.

We as a carrier will be transporting freight carrier responsibilities equipment.

So Carrier agrees to provide the necessary equipment and qualified personnel for completion of transportation

services.

So clearly, we as a carrier are not going to demand that the broker provides the equipment.

We are going to be providing the equipment and moving the load carrier shall be responsible for all

shipments subject to the terms and conditions of the uniform bill of lading.

Okay, they make sense.

Loss and damage carrier shall additionally indemnify broker from all loss, damage or costs.

So if the product is damaged or if we lose the product or if we damage the product, the broker will

not be responsible.

The carrier will be responsible.

This is okay.

This is standard insurance carrier shall furnish broker with certificate of insurance or insurance policies

providing 30 days advance written notice of cancellation or termination.

So obviously we're going to provide the insurance to the broker.

When we send this agreement, we'll provide them our insurance, our authority, our W-9, and we must

notify this broker if our insurance is going to be canceled or terminated.

Well, when I say our obviously, I mean the insurance of the carrier that we work with, I'm going

to skip through this carrier assumes full responsibility and liability for payment of the following

items, all applicable federal, state and local payroll taxes, taxes of unemployment insurance, old

age pensions, etcetera, etcetera.

So this part just states that broker will not be paying any taxes on behalf of the carrier.

The carrier is responsible for his own taxes.

And part four Miscellaneous.

A is independent contractor.

So this just states that carry is not an employee of the broker and broker is not an employee of the

carrier.

Non-exclusive agreement means a carrier can work with other brokers and broker can work with other carriers.

A waiver of provision disputes, actually, disputes is interesting because the parties agree to jurisdiction

of the federal and state courts at York, Pennsylvania.

So this broker is based in Pennsylvania, in the city of York.

And in case of any court procedures, in case of any disputes, the carrier will have to go to court

of Pennsylvania to sue this broker.

So they are the ones structuring the agreement.

So we have to agree to these terms.

No back solicitation, confidentiality.

This is all very, very standard.

I'm not going to stop on any more of these points.

And at the end here, we have a signature form.

It's already filled out on the broker site.

As you see, the signature is electronic.

In the US, you can sign agreements online with an online signature and exchange them by email.

No hard copies, no wet stamps.

Everything is very simple and convenient.

So depending on your agreement with the carrier, you might have the right to sign this yourself, or

you may have to fill everything out and then send it over to somebody for signing.

If you do need to sign the agreement.

This PDF editor I'm using has a sign option so I can create a new signature and I can either write it

out.

I don't know, for example, Dimitri and one of the signatures would be this.

Or I can draw actually use a mouse to, to proper sign it just like I would do on paper and put my legal

signature.

This is if the carrier wants you to sign it.

Otherwise you will fill out the carrier name.

You will fill out the company, address, phone and email, and then forward this carrier packet to

to the carrier, to the owner of the company or to one of the managers for signing.

And the last thing left here in this packet is a W-9.

You remember from last modules that this is a tax form and you will be sending the same form to the

broker on behalf of the carrier.

Most important thing here is the employer identification number.

They actually listed it, if you remember, they listed it in the very beginning, but they also put

it here.

So that's it.

That's what a carrier packet looks like.

Very standard.

And we can very quickly fill it out.

It will take us just a couple of minutes.

We scan this contract very quickly.

We just ran through the main points for your general understanding.

Why don't we focus on the contract, read every word and analyze every detail?

Well, because a dispatcher is not a lawyer.

Dispatcher's job is to fill out paperwork for booking cargo, not to deeply analyze every contract.

Our job is to make sure we sign a contract with a real broker with an active license and a good credit

history.

And we did that.

If you start working in a trucking company or you start providing dispatch services to a new customer

of yours and they give you special instructions, something they want you to pay attention to when you

sign a contract, then of course, you'll read through and look for those specifics.

Otherwise you just have to run your eyes over it and get it signed.

When you get a carrier packet, you need to fill it out in the shortest amount of time possible and

move on to other tasks.

The broker won't wait hours for you to sign the document.

They will turn around and give the shipment to somebody else.

And yes, I understand that reading contracts is important, but in the realities of the dispatchers

job and the required speed of completing tasks, it's unrealistic to do so.

That's it.

Packet is complete.

We go back to our email, click reply to the broker, attach the completed packet, attach the carrier's

company documents.

Always these are the documents we went over in the last module MRR Certificate, Certificate of Insurance

W-9 and notice of assignment if applicable and you're done.

Let's go to the next step.
