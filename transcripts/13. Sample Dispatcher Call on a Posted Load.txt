Good afternoon.

This is Linda with G Freight Logistics.

How may I help you?

Yes, Hi, Linda.

I'm calling on your load.

Uh, Chicago, Illinois, to Orlando, Florida, for today.

Uh huh, Okay, give me one second.

Let me check.

Uh huh.

It's still available.

Picks up in Chicago today, anytime before 6 p.m. and delivers on Wednesday in Orlando, Florida, at

Topia.

This is a set appointment, Â£42,000 of canned food on pallets.

We need a 53 drive and end of the rate on this one is 2500.

Okay.

Could you please repeat the appointment time for the delivery again?

2 p.m. on Wednesday in Orlando, Florida.

Okay.

Okay.

Thank you, Linda.

Uh, look, I'm going to be honest.

This load works for me, but I need to be closer to $3,000.

Do you have any flexibility on this rate?

I can do 3000, but I can go for 2600.

2600?

What about 29?

2900?

Um.

I may be able to do 2700.

What time can you talk?

Make it to the pickup.

Well, the truck is empty now in Chicago, so I could get him to the pickup before 5 p.m..

Okay, perfect.

That works.

Can you do 2700?

You know, actually, I already had a similar offer at 2700 and my driver said it was too low.

They just not going to let me book at at this price.

How about we meet in the middle at 2800 and we can book it right now.

Actually, 2700 is my maximum.

I can't go higher than that, buddy.

Yeah.

Yeah.

I mean, I would love to book at 27, but my driver is at home right now and honestly, he won't move

for anything less than 2800.

Do you think there's anything at all we can do to make it work?

Okay, Give me a second.

Are you still there?

Yeah.

Yeah, I'm here.

Okay, listen, I check with my boss.

I won't be able to do 2800, but I managed to get 2750 for you.

2007 2750.

Uh, yeah.

You know what?

Yeah.

Let's go for it.

Let's go for it.

We are already set up.

Let me give you my number and email.

Okay, let's go.
