Uh, yeah.

Hi, This is Dimitri with Pro Dispatch.

I'm trying to reach Ron.

Is he available?

Ron speaking.

How can I help you?

Oh, yeah.

Hi, Ron.

Look, I found your contact online.

We're a truck dispatching service.

I see here that you recently registered your authority.

I just wanted to give you a quick call, introduce myself, see if we can help you get access to more

load opportunities, increase your income, maybe help out with some documents, invoicing, setting

up with brokers.

Um.

Okay.

I'm on my own.

Really?

For now.

But how about I keep your contact in mind and maybe I'll give you a call sometime?

Um, what did you say your company was?

Yeah.

Pro Dispatch 24.

Ron, you run a dry van, correct?

Yeah, 26 foot van.

So a box truck?

Yeah, a box truck.

Okay.

Okay.

Look, Ron, we do a lot of work with box trucks.

You probably already got set up with some brokers, but I know the first couple of months can be challenging

at dispatch.

Service can help you a lot in terms of getting more contacts and more load opportunities.

I promise I won't try to sell you anything that you have to pay, you know, up front.

But if we manage to help you, we can work together.

If not, we go our separate ways.

Just give me two minutes of your time.

Okay, I'm listening.

Go ahead.

I don't have too much time, though, because I got to give my papers here and I'm waiting in line.

Okay.

Yeah, that's perfect.

Ron, a quick question first.

How do you currently manage your dispatching?

Um, well, I do it by myself.

Really?

I'm set up with some brokers just running southeast at the moment.

Um, picking up some loads here or there.

Okay.

Okay.

I see.

And are you set up with Amazon?

Uh, no, I don't do Amazon yet.

Okay, so first things first.

We can get you registered and run some loads with them as well as a number of other brokers that we

have good loads from for box trucks in the Southeast.

Ron What I can do for you for now is assign a personal dispatcher to you.

It's free of charge.

You don't have to pay anything until you actually accept a load that a dispatcher offers you.

In that case, the dispatcher will go ahead and get you set up with the broker, process all the documents,

book the load and send you the right confirmation.

Okay.

Just to confirm, I don't have to pay anything for the service.

No, no, not until we book a load for you.

So when you do, there is an 8% fee that's billed weekly, but it's not mandatory to book with us.

You can book your own loads just like you do now.

It's just an extra way of getting more loads for you, same way as you have your load boards and your

brokers.

You'll have a dispatcher that offers you loads that are specific to what you're looking for in terms

of areas and financials.

And also they'll process your documents and invoices.

It's all included in the commission.

Um, okay.

Yeah, that sounds good to me.

Um, I gotta run now though.

Can we do this tomorrow?

Yeah.

Yeah, absolutely.

We can get everything figured out tomorrow and I'll let you go for now.

But let me just quickly grab your email address so I can send you the setup packet.

Okay.

It's Ron Carlisle with.

With an S.

Uh, okay.

S after I.

Right.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Ron Dot Carlisle Transport with no space at gmail.com.

Okay.

Okay.

Got it.

Carlisle Transport at Gmail.

Okay.

Thank you, Ron.

I'll send you our packet and agreement.

And what's a good time tomorrow to get you connected with the dispatcher.

I'll call you myself first and then get your dispatch on the line so we can go through all the details

together.

Let's say around 9:00, 9:00, 9:00, 9 a.m. Eastern time, right?

Yeah, yeah.

Eastern time.

Um, okay.

I got to go.

Send me the setup and I'll.

I'll fill it out later at night.

Thanks, Ron.

Yeah, I'll send it right over.

You have a good rest of your day.

Thanks.

You as well.

Good bye.
