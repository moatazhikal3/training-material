So for your next step, we're going to look at data load board.

That's the one I've used for most of the demonstrations.

Getty is the market leader.

It's the Premier and the biggest load board on the United States market.

So you will definitely want to get that in addition to your one, two, three load board and to your

doffed accounts.

So you log in to gatcombe.

You can see the website right here on the top, and then you go into products and they have multiple

products.

But what you're interested in is the load board.

So I'm going to click load board.

They offer me to sign up now, but actually if I scroll all the way down, let's see.

There you go.

I will come to the package comparison.

Let's take a look at them.

So make sure you're here on the carrier side because they also have the load board accounts for brokers

combination of broker and carrier and for shippers.

What we're interested in is the carrier load board, the one that allows us to search for loads so they

have five packages.

It starts with a trackers edge data trackers edge standard, which is $45 a month currently.

And then the most expensive one power office carrier is a whopping $295 a month.

Once again, getting a load board and paying for a load board like that is only going to be required

for dispatchers who are going to be working as freelancers, as self-employed dispatchers.

So essentially for those who are going to make a business out of it and provide their services to,

you know, multiple carriers, multiple small carriers as customers.

So in that case, you will need to purchase a load board and to pay for a load board as well as some

other tools like a VoIP phone to call that more on that will be in module nine.

But if you're going to get a job.

So if you go the other route and you are getting employment in a trucking company, like as a remote

employee or remote agent in a trucking company or in a dispatching company, in that case, your employer

will certainly provide you all the tools.

You're not going to you're not going to have to go and buy them themselves.

And data load board will definitely be one of those.

So let's check the packages.

We're starting here.

So unlimited search posting is available for each one data one mobile app.

So you just like with the other load boards, you can use data on your computer or you can download

an application and use it on your phone if you're on the road or something.

Load match alarm.

So we've looked at that.

That's the alarm you can set and it will it will ring once, once something based on your search load.

A new load has appeared.

It will ring.

It will give you a little sound so you know that a new load has come up.

Mileage and routing broker created credit data.

So that's the broker credit score and the days to pay that we saw during the demonstration of the load

board and the load counts by state so that the in and out ratio that one will be available in all the

subscriptions and then the average lane rates.

So when that's the one we were looking at, when you search for a load and then you can go and see the

average rate for this load for the past days, that one is not available in the in the cheapest package

for $45.

So you're going to have to pay more.

And in truckers enhanced is going to show you historical data for the past 30 days.

But if you go for a more expensive package, it's going to show you data for the past 15 days call to

post search so you don't actually have to go on the load board.

If you're a driver, you're in a truck.

You can actually search and book loads by phone.

A manager will help you with that and then try hole.

This function will only be available in the third package.

The truckers edge professional so trial is suggested higher paying routes within triangular route suggestions.

So let's say you're looking for a load, let's say from Miami, Florida, going to New York and it's

a two day load and potentially they're going to pay quite low in terms of rate per mile if you go directly

from Miami to New York.

So this trial function on the will actually give you suggestions on how you can break up that longer

load into two shorter loads to maximize your rate per mile.

So maybe in our example it will recommend you to first go from Miami to, let's say, Atlanta, Georgia

and then from Atlanta to go to New York.

And this way you increase your rate per mile, or maybe it will suggest you to go to Alabama or North

Carolina.

So basically it will help you break.

Down a long low, paying loads into shorter, higher paying loads.

That's what the trial function can be used for.

We actually didn't look at it during our presentation, but it's going to be available if you buy truckers

professional or higher assurance helps carriers collect past due payments and then Canadian loads will

be available and then live load board.

So we if you don't go for the truckers Reg, if you go for the more expensive power option, your load

board will be live live search results with instant refresh.

So instead of you having to click refresh button every time to see new loads, the power load board

will actually refresh automatically and then you'll get the market conditions index.

The MCI.

That's something we looked at in module five.

Exact match alarms set an alarm for when a new load matches exactly what you're looking for.

Multiple searches and filtering is also available in the power.

So in Truckers Edge, you have to look for each load.

Individually.

You can only have one search, one load search going at a time.

With power, you can have multiple load searches at a time and then you can switch through them very

easily.

And then in the most expensive package, the one for $295 power of his career, you also get preferred

and blocked companies contract lane rates and lane makers.

Lane makers is something we looked at as well.

That's the tool that helps you find brokers that have been posting the most amount of loads for a certain

area or for a certain lane.

So that's the comparison of the packages.

If you if you're employed and you're working for a company, they they will be the one choosing the

package.

But for an independent dispatcher, that's going to be a choice for you.

I don't suggest paying 295, but you might want to go for either of these three packages because the

cheapest package doesn't provide you with average lane rates.

And this is an important tool for a beginner to see what brokers have been paying on average.

So I suggest going with one of these three packages.

Now you can go ahead and click Buy Now the only issue.

So I already clicked on buy.

Now let me switch here.

The only issue when you set up your account, first of all is going to ask you for authority type.

In the past, you could only get a data account if you had a D or an MSI number.

So you had to be a licensed carrier.

Now you can choose No or MSI.

And then in the type here, you have several options.

You can choose Carrier dispatcher, so you actually can get a data account.

Now being a dispatcher, you do not need to have a license, a carrier license, but it will ask you

for company name and for an address in the United States.

So that wants you to have a trucking company or a dispatching company if you're going to sign up.

So that's a bit of an issue for dispatchers.

For an independent dispatcher, the fastest and easiest way to get access to data is actually to request

an account from one of your customers.

And this is a perfectly normal practice.

There's nothing shameful or distrustful about it.

You can simply explain to the carrier that in order to comply with data rules, you only work with customers

accounts and you can either pay the account fee yourself so you can actually create an account with

a customer's name.

So customer's company name and his address and everything, and then pay for the account yourself.

Or you can agree that they will create an account for you basically, or provide you with their existing

account and then they will deduct the the cost of the load board from your dispatching fee.

So most new dispatchers get the account this way.

There's nothing wrong about it.

The second option for you is to get an account under your own company name and opening a company in

the US.

That's something we're going to discuss in a bit more detail in module nine, but actually it's not

that difficult.

You can open a company remotely.

You don't need to be a resident of the of the United States.

You don't need to be a citizen.

You don't need to go and visit the US yourself.

You don't even need to have any visa to go there.

So there's actually there are ways to open a company in the US completely remotely using a lawyer or

a special company that specializes on that.

It will cost you a bit of money.

So we'll not get too much into detail, but you can and I will show you how in the future modules open

a company in the US and then.

Open the account on your name, on your company, which honestly doesn't change anything.

As I said, most, if not all dispatchers open an account using one of the carriers, one of the customers

that they found.

They just list themselves as carrier dispatcher and then they go ahead and fill out the information

as the carrier.

Even if you open a account on your own company, they will still ask you because you're going to be

a carrier dispatcher.

You're not going to have an number.

So the will still ask you to provide the company name and the contact of at least one carrier that you

dispatch, and then you'll provide that information and they will actually call the carrier and ask

them, check with them whether this person is really dispatching them, and only then they will give

you access to the account.

So in any case, to get an account, you need to first find the carrier.

You don't.

If you don't know how to find carriers yet, that's once again, that's going to be the information

of module eight and module nine.

So don't worry about that.

Actually, finding a carrier to dispatch is not the difficult task at all.

It's actually quite easy and I'll provide you with free tools on how to do that.

The difficult part is to start dispatching that carriers, to start working to find them laws that they

like and to start generating commission.

That's why we're spending all this time learning the best practices on how to be a dispatcher.

But essentially, once you have a carrier, you will just ask them to provide you a account or to open

a VAT account under their name.

You will go through all of these details and then once again, you will need to input a credit card

or a debit card number in order to register, and then you will be able to use that immediately.

Another load board that we're going to look at is Truck Stop.

So the website is truck stop.com.

Truck stop is the main competitor of get.

As you can see here, they're showing how many loads they have.

So they have quite a lot of loads.

Sometimes they even have more loads than one, two, three load board.

As a dispatcher, you don't necessarily need to have a truck stop load board.

So usually a dad and a couple other load boards is sufficient.

But especially if you're working with flatbed carriers or step deck carriers, any platform trailers,

then truck stop typically has more loads for those types of equipments.

So you might want to get a truck stop if you have carriers with that type of equipment.

So here on truck stop, I'm already on the load board here.

You have three packages, basic advanced and pro package in basic cost, $39 per month.

You just get the standard load searching truck posting with the pro package, the one for $149.

You get all the analysis tools.

Essentially these are the same analysis tools, very similar to what you get with 1 to 3 load board

or load board load comparison, real time updates, rate insights.

So that's going to be your average rates.

Heatmap.

That's the same as the maps we saw on 1 to 3 and then on data that shows the load to truck ratio per

region or per state.

And then they also have some of their own features like Best Paint Load Search and Multi-trip.

So truck Stop is also a great option.

Once again, you will face the same problem as with data load boards.

They will want you to have a US based company in order to sign up.

And if I if I'm correct, they don't even have an option to register as a dispatch.

At some point they had an option.

Then they took it off.

So it might be different at the time you're watching the video, maybe they add it back, but in any

case, it costs more money.

And once again, just the same way as it was data load board, the easiest and most effective way to

get access to this load board is to first find the carrier that you will be dispatching and then either

register an account on their company name or ask them to provide you a truck stop account.

And for your third step is going to be getting access to broker load boards.

So many large brokerage firms have their own public load boards very often.

Actually, they will post loads on their own load board first and only after they will post it on a

public load.

Boards like that and one, two, three load boards they will post on their own load boards so that the

carriers who already signed up with them get a first pick, get a first choice of the loads, and then

those loads that haven't been sold after a little while will be posted on a public load board.

Some brokers will actually only post loads on their own load boards, like, for example, Amazon or

Uber freight.

Yeah, you heard correct Uber.

Just like the the taxi company, Uber actually has a very strong standing in the freight brokerage business

and their own load board, their own application allows carriers to book loads without calling the broker,

without negotiating rates.

So everything is done in the application.

There are many broker load boards.

I open this one as an example.

It's tcl.com.

So for many broker load boards you will first need to set up your carrier with that broker and then

they will give you access to the load board.

I chose this one because it actually you can get access right away.

So all the broker load boards are free.

Of course they're not going to charge you for them.

So this one is tcl.com and then you can go here into carriers and click on load board.

I already pre loaded it because a little bit slow but this is how it looks just looks like a normal

standard load board maybe less commercialized.

So I tried to do a search.

I searched for loads out of Dallas, Texas for tomorrow and you can see that there are actually many,

many load offers.

Some of them have rates, some don't.

But you know, large brokers have a lot of loads and.

You'll definitely want to get your carriers set up with as many brokers as possible.

And then with each broker, you can inquire whether they have a load boards and then get them signed

up for that load board.

So this way you have more load opportunities, you have more load options and you'll always have something

to offer to your carrier.

Look at that.

How many loads they have.

Okay.

I am going to leave a list of load boards for you right here in this lesson.

So you'll see it under the video.

It will include the public load boards that we discussed, the free ones, the paid ones, and I will

include a number of largest broker load boards so that when you sign up a carrier, when you start working,

you will already know what brokers to sign up and what load boards you can get access to immediately.
