1. Communication & Negotiation

Through years of coordinating with brokers and drivers, I developed strong communication and negotiation skills to secure fair rates and resolve conflicts professionally. For example, I’ve successfully negotiated TONU fees and higher-paying loads, which shows I can advocate for my team; this same skill will help me build trust with new clients and partners in my business.
2. Problem-Solving Under Pressure

In dispatching and logistics, unexpected cancellations, delays, and breakdowns happen daily, and I’ve learned to stay calm while quickly finding backup loads or alternative solutions. This ability to solve problems under pressure will allow me to adapt quickly in my new career, whether dealing with customers, projects, or operational setbacks.
3. Data & Market Analysis

By tracking load boards, analyzing rate trends, and reviewing weekly revenue reports, I gained strong analytical skills to spot patterns and optimize performance. I can apply this analytical approach in my business to identify opportunities, reduce risks, and make better decisions based on real numbers rather than assumptions.
