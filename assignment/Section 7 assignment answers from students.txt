Example 1:
A dispatcher booked a load that is scheduled for pickup at 19:00. The driver started driving towards the loading point at 17:30. At 18:00 the broker called the dispatcher back and canceled the load. What actions should the dispatcher take in this situation?

Hello, Jack.

I received your message regarding load cancellation. The driver is already reached the pickup location. I would like to request a TONU in the amount of $300. Please add it to the rate confirmation.

Best regards

During a weekly call, the owner of a transportation company expressed his dissatisfaction with the dispatcher. He states that over the past month, not a single truck has met the weekly financial plan and is convinced that the dispatcher is underperforming. What actions can the dispatcher take to avoid conflict and retain the customer?

Hello, Brad.

I know we have not reached our income targets in the past couple of weeks. I am taking this issue very seriously. I spent a lot of time analyzing the market and came up with several new rout plans that I believe will be more profitable for us. Give me a couple more weeks and I will find the best option for your trucks.

Best Regards

Immediately contact the driver and inform them that the load has been canceled by the broker. Instruct the driver to stop driving towards the loading point and return to their previous location or the nearest suitable location.

Apologize to the driver for the inconvenience and explain the situation. Assure the driver that they will be compensated for the time and fuel spent on the canceled load, as per the company's policies.

Update the dispatch records to reflect he canceled load and the action taken.

Explore alternative load options that the driver could potentially pick up to make the most of their available driving time and minimize downtime.


Communicate the canceled load and the actions taken to the broker, emphasizing the dispatcher's prompt  response and the driver's cooperation.

Acknowledge the owner's dissatisfaction and express a willingness to work together to improve the situation.

Request a detailed review of the past month's performance data, including load assignments, delivery times, revenue, and other relevant metrics. Analyze the data to identify any patterns or areas of improvement.
