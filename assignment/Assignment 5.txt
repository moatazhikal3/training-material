A dispatcher created a plan for his driver to drive at least 2,000 miles in a week. Along the way, one of the scheduled loads got canceled at the last minute and the dispatcher had to deviate from the plan. At the moment, his driver is in Nashville, TN. In 2 days, the driver is scheduled to return to Indianapolis, IN. So far, the driver has only traveled 1,500 miles, and Indianapolis is only 288 miles away.


Using Google Maps, find a suitable way out: an area where you can go from Nashville with a one day load, in order to then take a one day load to Indianapolis. That total mileage for the 2 loads has to be over 500 miles. Rate is not so important in this assignment, but still, try to choose major cities so that the dispatcher can easily find loads according to your plan.


Possible answer:

I found a great option. Nashville, TN - St Louis, MO - Indianapolis, IN. Total mileage: 552 miles. Enough to complete the weekly plan.
